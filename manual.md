Sure, let's break down the information into sections as requested, and I'll provide explanations in beginner-friendly terms.

### Components:

- ATmega8 microcontroller
- LCD display 1602
- Voltage divider resistors (100 kΩ and 10 kΩ)
- Current shunt (0.1 Ω)
- Operational amplifier (op-amp) [LM358]

### Voltage Measurement:

Voltage measurement is done using a voltage divider, which is made up of two resistors: 100 kΩ and 10 kΩ. This divider reduces the voltage so it can be safely measured. The maximum input voltage that can be applied to the voltage divider is 55V, and the formula for calculating the measured voltage is: 
```
U = ADC * Uref * K / 1024
```
Where:
- U is the result in Volts
- ADC is the result of the analog-to-digital conversion
- Uref is the reference voltage (2.56V)
- K is the voltage divider coefficient (11 for this setup)
- 1024 is the 10-bit ADC bit width.

### Current Measurement:

To measure current, a current shunt is used, which creates a small voltage drop proportional to the current. In this setup, the voltage drop is 0.1 V for 1 A and 0.2 V for 2 A. An op-amp is used to amplify this voltage for precise measurement. The op-amp is configured as a non-inverting amplifier with a gain of 10. The formula for calculating the measured current is:
```
I = ADC * Uref * K / 1024
```
Where:
- I is the result in Amperes
- ADC is the result of the analog-to-digital conversion
- Uref is the reference voltage (2.56V)
- K is the gain of the op-amp (10 for this setup)
- 1024 is the 10-bit ADC bit width.

### Program:

The program will measure voltage and current using the ATmega8's ADC (analog-to-digital converter). It uses an interruption-based approach. It will take 250 samples of both voltage and current, calculate the average values, and then display them on the LCD screen.


This code configures the microcontroller's ADC, initializes the LCD, and repeatedly measures voltage and current, displaying the results on the screen.

The code is written in C for an AVR microcontroller, and you would need the appropriate development tools to compile and upload it to the microcontroller. This explanation provides a high-level understanding of the code's purpose.
